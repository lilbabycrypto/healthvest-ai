## INTRO (0:00 - 0:30)

### Visual
- Title card: "HealthVest AI - Your Lab Report Companion"
- Subtitle: "Powered by Google MedGemma 1.5"

### Script
> "Have you ever received a lab report and felt completely lost? You're not alone. 4.5 billion people worldwide struggle to understand their medical data. Today, I'll show you how HealthVest AI uses Google's MedGemma to transform confusing lab reports into clear, personalized health conversations."

---

## PROBLEM (0:30 - 1:00)

### Visual
- Show a typical lab report (blurred/sample)
- Highlight confusing medical terms

### Script
> "Here's a typical lab report. Hemoglobin, HbA1c, TSH... these terms mean nothing to most people. Reference ranges are confusing. And there's no one to explain what YOUR specific numbers mean for YOUR health. Current solutions like Google search give generic answers, not personalized insights."
